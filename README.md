# Full_Train_BERT_MNLI
Full training "bert-base-uncased" checkpoint on "glue-mnli" dataset

## 🧠 GLUE MNLI Dataset
The Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MNLI) dataset is part of the GLUE Benchmark, designed to evaluate a model's ability to perform natural language understanding tasks.

## 📘 Task Definition
The task is to determine the semantic relationship between a premise and a hypothesis sentence. Each example is labeled as one of the following:

**entailment (0)**: The hypothesis logically follows from the premise.  
**neutral (1**): The hypothesis might be true, but is not guaranteed.  
**contradiction (2)**: The hypothesis contradicts the premise.  

| Premise                                           | Hypothesis                                      | Label         |
|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| A soccer game with multiple males playing.       | Some men are playing a sport.                   | Entailment    |
| An older and younger man smiling.                | Two men are smiling at the cats playing around. | Neutral       |
| A man inspects the uniform of a figure.          | The man is sleeping.                            | Contradiction |

## 📊 Dataset Structure
The MNLI dataset contains examples drawn from a wide range of genres to test generalization across domains.

| Split                 | Description                                        | Labels Available |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| train                | Training data from multiple genres (~392k samples) | ✅ Yes           |
| validation_matched   | Validation data from the same genres as train      | ✅ Yes           |
| validation_mismatched| Validation data from different genres              | ✅ Yes           |
| test_matched         | Test data from same genres (for leaderboard use)   | ❌ No (labels = -1) |
| test_mismatched      | Test data from new genres (for leaderboard use)    | ❌ No (labels = -1) |

### ✅ Matched vs Mismatched:  
**Matched** = in-domain (same genre as training)  
**Mismatched** = out-of-domain (unseen genres, testing robustness)

## 📦 Features
**premise** *(string)*: The original sentence.  
**hypothesis** *(string)*: Sentence to compare against the premise.  
**label** *(int)*: 0 = entailment, 1 = neutral, 2 = contradiction.  
**genre** *(string)*: Source genre (e.g., fiction, government).  
**idx** *(int)*: Unique index of the example.

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the MNLI dataset
raw_datasets = load_dataset("glue", "mnli")
```
## ⚡ Training and Evaluation

### Model:
- Pretrained model: `bert-base-uncased`
- Task: Sequence Classification (MNLI)
- Framework: Hugging Face Transformers

### Evaluation Setup:
- Combined the **matched** and **mismatched** evaluation datasets for a more comprehensive evaluation.

### Results:
- **Accuracy on evaluation data**: **83.11%** (combined matched and mismatched evaluation datasets)

```python
eval_results = {'accuracy': 0.8310683564920853}
```
This result was achieved by combining both validation_matched and validation_mismatched datasets, which provides a more generalized view of model performance across both in-domain and out-of-domain examples.

## 🧪 Purpose of the Test Notebook

The **Test notebook** is used to evaluate the model on the **test_matched** and **test_mismatched** datasets from the **MNLI** dataset. These datasets do not contain ground truth labels, so the notebook generates predictions to be submitted to the **GLUE leaderboard**.

### Key Points:
1. **Model Evaluation**: Generates predictions for the test datasets (matched and mismatched) to assess the model's performance.
2. **Leaderboard Submission**: Predictions are submitted to the **GLUE leaderboard**, where they are compared against hidden ground truth labels.
3. **No Direct Label Comparison**: Since the test datasets have no labels, this step is for final evaluation only.
4. **Metrics**: The leaderboard ranks models based on accuracy and other metrics after submission.

In summary, the test notebook is for generating predictions on the test set and submitting them to the GLUE leaderboard for official evaluation.
